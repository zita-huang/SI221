1. Why do you think it was done that way?
    grade.cpp was done in such a way that the pass by reference avoids copying and pasting.
    By using pass by reference it allows for the control of hiding information. One of the ways
    to get pass this is to create a copy constructor in order to create similar contents to grade.cpp,
    otherwise it would have to only be implemented as grade.o. It also allows for the safe keeping of the heap
    especially when it is being used for either implementation or as an interface. 

2. Did it need to be done that way? And if not, what would you/someone need to change to do it another way?
    It did not necessarily need to be implemented this way. The author could have made the grade.cpp
    and grade.h using a copy constructor that would take in different inputs, while also ensuring that
    the copy constructor would also be pointing to different nodes.

3. What member functions would you want to be available to the user of such a class? What constructors? 
   Would a destructor be needed? Would pass by value or assignment be a problem for this class?
    When using a linked list a constructor and destructor would be needed for the class. There would be
    member functions calling in the student names, getting the grades of each student, and getting the
    average of each student in the class. The same issue from grades.cpp would apply to this class as well.
