Placing the member function within the class:
-creator has the opportunity to make it private, therefore unaccessible to the user
-creator can make it public within the class
-makes the member function to be inline

Placing the member function into a .cpp file:
-violates the principles of hiding information
-can be used globally as long as the .cpp file is included in the main.cpp file
-can hide how it is implemented if creator does not give access to .cpp file
